 INSPIRATION
 Personally since my childhood at only 6 years, I was this kind of person who loved Public Gatherings. The way the people who conducted them used to behave, give strong speeches and encouraging words. When I joined Mengo Senior School, my inspiration was Sello Julius Malema one of the famous politicians in South Africa . He is determined by courageosness.


                                    what have you learnt ?
                                    We are living with good and positive people also bad people. I got people who encourage and made me love this and those who discourage.
                                    God being my guide. Having good mentors on chaning something 
                                    Being determined and not to give up, believing in oneself .
                                    Loving what you do (your work)
                                    Giving up some situaations for the better so as to give a good example i.e sacrififing something because of the responsibilites and title you have to uphold.
                                    As a leader, I learnt that this world is for perfectionists therefore we must present our ideas for perfection.
                                    Preparing the next generation to be better leaders than we have been .
                                    CHALLENGES FACED
                                    Moibilising people into one person because every one has different ideologies and if is not easy mobilising them.
                                    My fellow leader, some have shown that they are not her eto serve their people but show business.
                                    Balancing academics and leadership is also not easy and concentrating on one oneself.
                                    Since we are new leaders in powewr, we have hard time with some administrations and some teachers are too tough.
