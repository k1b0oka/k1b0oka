We are living with good and positive people also bad people. I got people who encourage and made me love this and those who discourage.
God being my guide. Having good mentors on chaning something 
Being determined and not to give up, believing in oneself .
 Loving what you do (your work)
 Giving up some situaations for the better so as to give a good example i.e sacrififing something because of the responsibilites and title you have to uphold.
 As a leader, I learnt that this world is for perfectionists therefore we must present our ideas for perfection.
Preparing the next generation to be better leaders than we have been .
                                    
                       
                                    CHALLENGES FACED
                              
 Moibilising people into one person because every one has different ideologies and if is not easy mobilising them.
 My fellow leader, some have shown that they are not her eto serve their people but show business.
 Balancing academics and leadership is also not easy and concentrating on one oneself.
 Since we are new leaders in powewr, we have hard time with some administrations and some teachers are too tough.
 
 DHP O LEVEL - ABEHO MUKAMA GLEN.
 

 HOW DID YOU FEEL DURING ELECTIONS?
 A little bit pressureb by the competition he had with Rickson.
 He had a hard time accessing the whole school and convicing them to vote for him since most students in O level showed more love for the competitor.


 Did you have any fear of losing?
 Not at all . I was confident that I woul go through and by Gods gace I did.


 How did you feel when you were announced winner?
 He was really happy and wasnt actually that shocked because during the voting I was getting information from people.
 So when I was getting information from people . So when I was announced victor, I expected it.

 Any challenges so far?
 so far the only challenge has been having to decide betweeen the students and teachers. 
 It gets hard to make a decision that will make both parties happy without inconveniencing any of them.
 Any words of advice to your fellow students?
 Sometimes its better to listen to your heart and follow your instincts. Above all,pray to God and ask him to always help you.
